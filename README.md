# Straw Aficionado

### About
An application for those of us who appreciate a well made straw. It features authentication and a postgres database hosted with Supabase. Made mainly to learn about supabase and how to set up a proper authentication system. 

### Installation
This app was made using Create React App. NPM install will download all necessary dependencies. For local development, you will also want to add a proxy to the package.json file to route to the server at 8080. This project is not intended to be a template for general use. However, if you want this application to work on your machine you will need to make a number of adjustments. First you will need to setup a supabase project and obtain the supabase url and non keys. You will also need the server key for admin functionality on the server side. The supabase docs are pretty good, I'd start there.
